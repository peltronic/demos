Here are the details of the code challenge.  Please complete 24 hours prior to your interview.  

Code Challenge!  We would like for you to write an API endpoint in PHP, which upon execution accepts two arguments.  

One of those arguments should be a “total cost” (in dollars and/or cents) and the other an “amount provided” (also in dollars and/or cents).   Return as output the change that should be provided, **by returning the count of each denomination of bills and/or coins**.  +points for object oriented and/or advanced concepts.  

As a reminder, our current tech stack is:  Centos, MySQL, PHP, Symfony, Doctrine, APIPlatform, Jenkins, PHPUnit, Behat.   Have fun with it!
